# WnCC Screening Task

This repository contains a Web-Scraping App developed to scan for the frequency of occurence of a particular word in all the Lyrics of a Particular Artist and also compare said frequencies.
This app uses Python3, BeautifulSoup4 and (obviously) ChromeDriver.
Note that this uses Chrome and a corresponding version for Mozilla can be created just as easily.

Enjoy!
